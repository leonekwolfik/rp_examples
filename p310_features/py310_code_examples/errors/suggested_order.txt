I went through the errors in the What's New doc in the order they presented,
but, there is probably a better grouping, keeping like stuff together:


Dictionaries and comprehensions:
    e02
    e04
    e05
    e07
    e01

Exceptions:
    e06
    e08

Other:
    e03
    e10
    e11
    e12
    e13
